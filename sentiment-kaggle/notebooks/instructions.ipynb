    "This notebook is a demonstration of the deployment process of a simple sentiment classification model using `scikitlearn`. The model will be trained on 20NewsGroups data set available in scikit to train a NaiveBayes classifier for sentiment prediction. We'll also be using the `streamlit` package to deploy a frontend to our model to allow end users to submit text for classification and testing.\n",

    "The Notebook is divided in the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup & Environment\n",
    "2. Load & Exploring the Data\n",
    "3. Feature Extraction (Bag of Words, Tokenization, Frequency Distribution)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "The most intuitive way to do so is to use a bags of words representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign a fixed integer id to each word occurring in any document of the training set (for instance by building a dictionary from words to integer indices).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each document #i, count the number of occurrences of each word w and store it in X[i, j] as the value of feature #j where j is the index of word w in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bags of words representation implies that n_features is the number of distinct words in the corpus: this number is typically larger than 100,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "If n_samples == 10000, storing X as a NumPy array of type float32 would require 10000 x 100000 x 4 bytes = 4GB in RAM which is barely manageable on today’s computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, most values in X will be zeros since for a given document less than a few thousand distinct words will be used. For this reason we say that bags of words are typically high-dimensional sparse datasets. We can save a lot of memory by only storing the non-zero parts of the feature vectors in memory.\n",
